Hello again! Now let's build a quick REST API. Feel free to use
any frameworks or libraries you want as long as your server runs
with `start_server.sh`.
 
The example here is provided with Flask. Feel free to extend it if 
you wish.

The database is provided by `database.py`. It's a sortiment of
of planets which can have one or more moons.

The existing API is very lacking:

```bash
curl 
```
