# Hello again 

We need assistance! Our fancy planetary database lacks a REST-API. Let's
build one!

Start by *creating a new branch based on master*. Name the branch after
yourself, please.

Feel free to use any frameworks or libraries you want as long as your 
server runs with `start_server.sh` and uses the database provided by 
`database.py`. The example here is provided with Flask. Feel free to 
extend it if you wish.

The existing API is very lacking:

```bash
curl 94.237.48.28:8000/planets
["mars", "earth"]
```
